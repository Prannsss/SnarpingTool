# 🖼️ SnarpingTool

SnarpingTool is a simple Python-based desktop tool that captures screenshots and processes them using libraries like `pyautogui`, `tkinter`, `opencv-python`, and more. This repository includes all the steps to turn the project into a standalone `.exe` app for Windows — no need to install Python.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Capture and process screen content
- Works with common libraries like `pyautogui`, `tkinter`, and `Pillow`
- Exported as a `.exe` for easy distribution

---

## 🛠️ How to Build the App on Windows 10

### ✅ Step 1: Install Dependencies

Open Command Prompt and install all required Python packages:

```bash
pip install pyautogui Pillow opencv-python numpy
````

> `tkinter` is usually bundled with Python on Windows. If it’s missing, install Python via [python.org](https://www.python.org/) and make sure "tkinter" is included.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Install PyInstaller

To package the Python script into an executable:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Create the `.exe` File

Navigate to your project folder and run:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole app.py
```

* `--onefile`: Packages everything into one `.exe`
* `--noconsole`: Hides the terminal window (ideal for GUI apps)

---

### ✅ Step 4: Locate and Run the App

Your `.exe` will be located in the `dist/` folder:

```
SnarpingTool/
├── build/
├── dist/
│   └── app.exe ← Run this file
└── screen_toolkit_app.spec
```

You can now share this `.exe` with anyone using Windows!
